## Requirements

- Home Assistant 2023.1 or newer
- Google Find My Device integration (or any GPS-enabled device_tracker)
- Recorder integration enabled (for location history)
- Modern browser with ES6 module support
- Internet connection for OpenStreetMap tiles and Leaflet.js CDN

## Troubleshooting

### No devices showing
- Ensure you have GPS-enabled device_tracker entities
- Check that device tracker entities exist in Developer Tools → States
- Verify entity names in card configuration
- Try using `filter_keywords` in the visual editor to find your devices

### Map not loading
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify internet connection (Leaflet loads from CDN)
- Ensure device has valid GPS coordinates (latitude/longitude attributes)
- Try disabling browser extensions that might block external resources

### Location history not showing
- Verify Home Assistant recorder integration is enabled
- Check that your device has historical location data in Developer Tools → History
- Try selecting a longer time range (7 days instead of 1 day)
- Clear browser cache and reload the page

### Filters not persisting
- Check browser localStorage is enabled
- Ensure you're using the same browser/device
- Try clearing site data and reconfiguring filters

### Actions not working
- Ensure Google Find My Device integration services are available
- Check Home Assistant logs for service call errors
- Verify device IDs match entity naming (e.g., `device_tracker.phone` → device_id: `phone`)

### Mobile display issues
- The card is optimized for mobile with responsive breakpoints at 768px
- Device sidebar has adjusted spacing to avoid overlapping zoom controls
- Try rotating device to landscape for larger map view
